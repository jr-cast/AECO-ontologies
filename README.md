# AECO-ontologies
<div style="text-align: justify"> With AECO industry migrating from documents to model-based data-rich
approaches, there is an increasing  need to standardise how AECO data is
produced, stored and exchanged among parties during different stages 
of a building development. Furthermore, as each stakeholder utilise
field-related tools suites for outputting custom data structures suited to their
respective areas, information heterogeinity increases with every project 
iteration. 

To address this, researchers have envisioned distributed and interdisciplinary 
environments where information is exchanged among stakeholders thru web-apps.
As a result, the adoption of semantic web technologies (SWT) to generate 
linked-data building models over the web is being identified as a promising path
to increase data interoperability in the AECO industry.

The following examples showcase some of the current efforts of the open-source 
community to address the aforementioned problematic. Hence, by implementing 
semantic models, standarisation of the physical, 
logical and virtual assets and the relationships between can be accomplish thru
building information models instantiated by semantic-web ontologies/vocabularies.
