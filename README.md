Adoption of semantic web technologies (SWT)
to generate linked-data building models is 
promising to increase data interoperability in the construction industry. 
The following examples showcase some of the current efforts of the open-source 
community. Hence, by implementing SWT, standarisation of the physical, 
logical and virtual assets and the relationships between them can be accomplish 
thru instantiated specific (but linked) domain ontologies/vocabularies.

1. [Brick](https://brickschema.org); a semantic schema seeking an efficient deployment of building
analytics apps thru the creation, implementation  and querying of integrated 
semantic models.

2. [BOT](https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot); a minimal ontology to describe anything in the context of a building 
and to the components (products) that comform them.
It was suggested as an extensible baseline for use along with more domain 
specific ontologies following general W3C principles of encouraging reuse and 
keeping the schema no more complex than necessary.

3. [OMG](https://www.projekt-scope.de/ontologies/omg/#hasComplexGeometryDescription); ontology for attaching geometry 
descriptions to their corresponding things (e.g. building objects).

4. [DigitalBuildings](https://google.github.io/digitalbuildings); an ontology divised by Google, following the steps of brick 
and haystack, concerned with modeling the characteristics and telemetry of entities, and their relationships with each other. 

Examples describe the "Tutorial Exercise 2" from the ["Getting with EnergyPlus"
guide](https://energyplus.net/sites/default/files/pdfs_v8.3.0/GettingStarted.pdf)  
Finally, the models describing the building will be linked togueter 
in an attemp to infer new relationships and, thus, showcase how
AECO interoperability can increase by establishing consensus among staholders 
thru a common-data understanding (semantic layer)
