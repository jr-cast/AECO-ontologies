! Introduction to EnergyPlus - Exercise 2C
!
! Building: Single floor rectangular building 30.5 m (100 ft) x 15.2 m (50 ft). 5 zones -
!           4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 2.4 m (8 ft). Exterior zone
!           depth is 3.7 m (12 ft). There is a 0.6 m (2 ft) high return plenum. The
!           overall building height is 3m (10 ft). There are windows on
!           all 4 facades; the south and north facades have glass doors.
!           The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls
!           are woodshingle over plywood, R11 insulation, and gypboard.
!           The roof is a gravel built up roof with mineral board
!           insulation and plywood sheathing. The floor slab is 0.1 m (4 in)
!           of heavy concrete. The windows and glass doors are double
!           pane Low-e clear glass with argon gap. The window to wall ratio is
!           approximately 0.3.
!
!           The building is oriented with the long axis running east-west.
!
! Floor Area:        463.6 m2 (5000 ft2)
!
! Internal: Lighting is 16 W/m2 (1.5 W/ft2), office equip is 10.8 W/m2 (1.0 W/ft2).
!           1 occupant per 9.3 m2 (100 ft2) of floor area. The
!           Infiltration is 0.25 air changes per hour.
!
! HVAC:     Single-zone unitary with DX cooling and gas heating serving NORTH PERIMETER zone.
!           VAV with hot water reheat, return plenum, chiller, boiler, and tower serving
!           the other four occupied zones.
